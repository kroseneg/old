To build and install it, just do 'make install'.

It defaults to prefix /usr/local, you can override by setting 'PREFIX' to
something else, like:

make PREFIX=/usr install


You shouldn't need to configure anything, but if you want to, check out the
file named 'Make.conf' which refers to the building procedure, and
'include/config.h' which include some constants you can tune to adjust
internal parameters.

Please also read the README file.
