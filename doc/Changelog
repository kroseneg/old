01 Jan 04 18.50.56 - Alberto <albertogli@telpin.com.ar>
 * tag: 0.12 tag; from now on I'll start to use Andrew Morton's patch scripts
	so this is probably the latest changelog in this format.

28 Dec 03 12.34.04 - Alberto <albertogli@telpin.com.ar>
 * libold.c: Remove bogus comments inside the code, old debugging code, and
	add a simple header.
 * doc: Update doc/multithreading and add a brief comment about scheduler
	interaction.
 * net.c: Create a new array, fd_busy, to mark when a thread is working on a
	fd so that we avoid having another thread working on it
	simultaneously.
 * oldtest2.c: Add a new oldtest variant, called oldtest2, which locks N
	different objects simultaneously, and then unlocks them.
 * doc: Add some performance documentation.

27 Dec 03 19.31.20 - Alberto <albertogli@telpin.com.ar>
 * utils: add a script to work with Andrew Morton patch scripts
 * net.c: If select fails, handle the error properly by rebuilding the fd
	sets; this avoids a bug where a fd is closed while it's still in the
	active list, making select to fail and fall into an endless loop.
 * net.c: Use maxfd to limit the number of file descriptors to look when
	constructing the sets for select(), and simplify the intial
	construction.
 * net.c: Replace the busy loop used to look for an idle thread with a normal
	one, and just go back to select() if there was none.
 * net.c: Make the select thread renice itself to the lowest priority, to
	avoid stealing time from workers when looping looking for an idle
	thread.
