This document describes the tunable options in the include/config.h file for
the lock daemon.

HLEN		It defines the lenght of the hash table that holds the locked
		objects; a value of 50 is ok for normal loads, if you have a
		lot of lock at a time, increase it; if you have very serious
		memory constraints you can decrease this value.

PORT		It's the TCP port where we listen to network connections, we
		use 2626 but you can change this value if you want (note that
		you would have to change the clients too)

MAXCONN		Maximum number of simultaneous network connections

ORPHAN_TIMEOUT	This is the time in seconds after which we unlock the objects
		that are considered orphans, which means that the connection
		who locked them was closed (and they were left locked)
